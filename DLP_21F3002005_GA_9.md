6. **Run the Notebook**: Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to reproduce the analysis and results.

## Analysis of the Chosen Model

I had experimented with 4 models. Those being - `VIT B`, `VIT L 16`, `ResNet 150`, and `Swin T`. The final model chosen for this analysis is `swin_t`. Below is a summary of the model and its performance:

### Model: `swin_t`

- **Architecture**: Swin Transformer (Tiny)
- **Final Score**: 0.87

### Comparison with Other Models:

- **VIT B**: The Vision Transformer (Base) model, while effective, did not perform as well as `swin_t` due to its higher computational complexity and less efficient handling of local features.
- **VIT L 16**: The Vision Transformer (Large, 16x16 patches) model, although powerful, was less efficient in terms of training time and required more computational resources compared to `swin_t`.
- **ResNet 150**: The ResNet 150 model, a deep convolutional neural network, was outperformed by `swin_t` due to the latter's ability to capture both local and global features more effectively.

### Key Points:

- The Swin Transformer model was selected due to its superior performance in handling image data.
- The model was trained and evaluated using a specific dataset, and the final score achieved was 0.87.
- The notebook includes detailed steps for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and performance metrics.

### Conclusion:

The `swin_t` model demonstrated robust performance with a final score of 0.87, making it a suitable choice for the given task. The notebook provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the entire process, from data preparation to model evaluation.
